# 📚 Comic Books Lending Library

A comprehensive full-stack .NET 9 Blazor application for comic book readers, specializing in the 45+ demographic. Built with Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, and MudBlazor UI framework.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Comic Books Lending Library is designed to connect mature comic book collectors, enabling free comic book loans between collectors. Users can borrow comics from each other for a specified period, with the requirement that they offer one of their own comics in return. This creates a mutual lending system where both parties benefit.

### 🔄 Key Concept: Mutual Lending

- **🤝 Borrow a comic, lend a comic**: To borrow someone's comic, you must offer one of yours in return
- **⏰ Timed loans**: Comics are loaned for a specific period (7-90 days)
- **🔒 Unavailable while on loan**: Comics that are currently loaned out cannot be borrowed by others
- **⚖️ Mutual responsibility**: Both parties are responsible for returning comics in the same condition

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 📦 Projects

#### 1. 🔌 ComicBooksExchangeAppAPI (ASP.NET Core Web API)

REST API backend managing all business logic, data persistence, and service layer.

**Key Components:**

- **Models**: Domain entities (Comic, User, LoanRequest, Loan, Exchange, Transaction, Review)
- **Data**: Entity Framework Core DbContext and migrations
- **Repositories**: Generic and specialized repositories implementing the repository pattern
- **Services**: Business logic layer with async operations
- **Controllers**: RESTful API endpoints for Comics, Users, and Loans
- **Validators**: Data validation and business rule enforcement
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for API communication

#### 2. 🖥️ A6-ComicBooksExchangeApp (Blazor Server Application)

Server-side rendering Blazor application providing the primary UI.

**Key Components:**

- **Components/Pages**: Full-page Razor components (Home, Comics, Loans, Profile)
- **Layout**: Navigation and layout components
- **Services**: Integration with API backend

#### 3. 🌐 A6-ComicBooksExchangeApp.Client (Blazor WebAssembly)

Client-side interactive components for enhanced UX.

**Key Components:**

- **SearchFilterComponent**: Advanced search with autocomplete
- **ComicCard**: Interactive comic display component
- **LoanRequestDialog**: Form for requesting comic loans

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### 📊 Tables

- **Users**: Collector profiles with ratings and verification status
- **Comics**: Comic book listings with condition grades, valuations, and loan status
- **LoanRequests**: Loan proposals between collectors
- **Loans**: Active and completed loan records
- **Reviews**: Ratings and feedback after loans/exchanges

### 📝 Loan System Fields

Comics now include:

- `IsOnLoan`: Whether the comic is currently loaned out
- `CurrentLoanId`: Reference to the active loan
- `LoanReturnDate`: Expected return date when on loan

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔗 Composite Foreign Keys**: Relationships between all entities
- **🚀 Indexes**: Optimized queries on frequently searched fields (Username, Email)
- **✅ Data Integrity**: Cascading deletes and referential constraints

- Logging available for debugging

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **🗄️ Setup Database**
   - Update connection string in `appsettings.json` or `Program.cs`
   - Run migrations: `dotnet ef database update`

2. **▶️ Run API**
   - Navigate to `ComicBooksExchangeAppAPI`
   - `dotnet run`
   - API available at `https://localhost:7291`

3. **🌟 Run Blazor App**
   - Start both server and client projects
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:7001`

## 🐳 Docker (Production-faithful Local Dev)

This repo includes Docker files for both the API and the Blazor Server app, plus a local MySQL container so your local environment matches production.

- API Dockerfile: `ComicBooksLoanAppAPI/Dockerfile`
- Web (Blazor Server) Dockerfile: `A6-ComicBooksLoanApp/Dockerfile`
- Local stack (MySQL + API + Web): `docker-compose.yml`

### ▶️ Run locally with MySQL

From the repo root:

- 🔨 Build + run: `docker compose up --build`
- 🌐 App: `http://localhost:5144`
- 🔌 API: `http://localhost:5259`

Notes:

## ☁️ Render Deployment (No-data / 502 troubleshooting)

If the deployed UI renders but shows no data and the browser/network or server logs show `502 (Bad Gateway)` from API calls, it usually means the API service is unhealthy (crashing on startup or failing its health check).

### ✅ What the UI is calling

The Blazor app calls the API using `ApiBaseUrl` + relative paths like `api/admin/announcements`.

- Base URL is configured in [A6-ComicBooksLoanApp/Program.cs](A6-ComicBooksLoanApp/Program.cs)
- Render sets `ApiBaseUrl` in [render.yaml](render.yaml)

So the failing request is typically:

- `https://comics-loan-api.onrender.com/api/admin/announcements`

### 🔧 Required Render environment variables

In the Render dashboard:

1. Service **comics-loan-api**
2. **Environment** tab
3. Add this as a **Secret**:

- `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=Server=<host>;Port=<port>;Database=defaultdb;User=<user>;Password=<password>;SslMode=Required;`

If you copied an Aiven “Service URI” like `mysql://user:pass@host:port/db?...`, convert it to the ADO.NET-style connection string above.

### 🔍 Quick checks

- Visit `https://comics-loan-api.onrender.com/healthz` (should return `ok`). If it returns `502`, check the **comics-loan-api** logs for DB connection errors.

### 💤 Cold-start note ("I must hit /healthz first")

On Render free tiers (or any platform that sleeps services), the API can be spun down when idle. The first request after a period of inactivity may return `502/503` briefly while the container is waking.

- Symptom: the UI loads but data appears only after you manually visit `https://comics-loan-api.onrender.com/healthz`.
- Mitigation: the web app uses an HTTP retry handler for idempotent API calls to tolerate cold-starts, but you may still see a short delay on the first load.

### 🧭 Deployed UI calling `localhost`

If **Messages** and **Community** work locally but not when deployed, check that UI components are not calling `http://localhost:5259/...`.

- In production, the UI must call the API via `ApiBaseUrl` + relative paths like `api/users` and `api/messages/...`.

- Local DB credentials in `docker-compose.yml` are for local-only.
- The API is configured with `Database__Provider=MySql` and uses `EnsureCreated()` for MySQL startup.

## 🚢 Deploy to Render.com (Docker)

You will typically deploy **two Render Web Services**:

1) **API service** (Dockerfile: `ComicBooksLoanAppAPI/Dockerfile`)
2) **Web service** (Dockerfile: `A6-ComicBooksLoanApp/Dockerfile`)

### 🔧 Render: API service environment variables

Set these in the Render dashboard (do NOT commit secrets):

- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` = `Production`
- `Database__Provider` = `MySql`
- `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` = `Server=<host>;Port=<port>;Database=defaultdb;User=<user>;Password=<password>;SslMode=Required;`
- `Cors__AllowedOrigins__0` = `https://<your-web-service>.onrender.com`

For your deployed services:

- `Cors__AllowedOrigins__0` = `https://comics-loan-app.onrender.com`

### 🌐 Render: Web service environment variables

- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` = `Production`
- `ApiBaseUrl` = `https://<your-api-service>.onrender.com`

For your deployed services:

- `ApiBaseUrl` = `https://comics-loan-api.onrender.com`

### 🔌 Aiven MySQL connection string

Render expects you to put this into `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` (API service):

- Host: `mysql-3ed4a6c-andrenormanlang-7af0.g.aivencloud.com`
- Port: `28197`
- Database: `defaultdb`
- User: `avnadmin`
- SSL: required (`SslMode=Required`)

Security:

- If you pasted your DB password into chat or any public place, rotate it in Aiven.
